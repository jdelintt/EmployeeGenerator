# EmployeeGenerator

When deployed, this app will run in the terminal

As it runs in the terminal the app will prompt the user to generate information about three employees:
-An engineer
-An intern
-A Manager

The terminal will ask specific information about each employee that the user chooses.

That information will then generate a card for each employee

That card that is generated will appear in the team.html file once the user clicks "Finished Adding" in the terminal
